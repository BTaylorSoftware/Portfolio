# Portfolio for Brian L. Taylor
## First things first.

This respository is designed to demonstrate a few areas of software development that I am interested in. Hopefully, some of these examples will be of use in evaluating me for future clients or employers.
If you were directed here from my resume, be aware that I do not cover all of my skills in this repository, but only provide a small set of demonstration code. Sort of a "hello-world". :bowtie:
